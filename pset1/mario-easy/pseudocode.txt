Start:
    Define an integer variable called 'height'

    Repeat:
        Ask the user "height:"
        Read the value entered by the user into 'height'

        If 'height' is less than 1 or greater than 8:
            Print "Invalid input. Enter a number between 1 and 8."
        Else:
            Continue

    While height < 1 or height > 8

    For each line from 1 to height:
        Calculate the number of hashes (#) as equal to the current line number
        Calculate the number of spaces as equal to (height - current line number)

        Print the spaces
        Print the hashes (#)
        Print a newline after each row

End
