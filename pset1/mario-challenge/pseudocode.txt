START
    Define an integer variable 'height'  // User input for the height of the pyramid

    Repeat:
        Ask the user "Height:"
        Read the value entered by the user into 'height'

        If 'height' is less than 1 OR 'height' is greater than 8:
            Print "Height must be between 1 and 8."
        Else:
            Continue

    While 'height' is less than 1 OR 'height' is greater than 8

    For 'i' from 1 to 'height' (inclusive):
        // For each row of the pyramid
        For 'j' from 'i' to 'height - 1' (inclusive):
            Print a space (for the left pyramid)

        For 'j' from 1 to 'i' (inclusive):
            Print a hash symbol (#) (left side of the pyramid)

        Print two spaces (to separate the two pyramids)

        For 'j' from 1 to 'i' (inclusive):
            Print a hash symbol (#) (right side of the pyramid)

        Print a new line (to move to the next row)
