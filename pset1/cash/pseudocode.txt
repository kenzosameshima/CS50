START
    Define a float variable 'change'
    Define an integer variable 'cents'
    Define an integer variable 'coin_count'

    Repeat:
        Ask the user "Change owed:"
        Read the value entered by the user into 'change'

        If 'change' is less than 0:
            Print "Invalid input. Enter a positive amount."
        Else:
            Continue

    While 'change' is less than 0

    Set 'cents' to round(change * 100)  // Convert to cents, round to avoid floating-point issues

    Set 'coin_count' to 0  // Initialize coin count

    Define an array 'coins' with denominations: [25, 10, 5, 1]

    For each coin in 'coins':
        While 'cents' is greater than or equal to the coin:
            Subtract the coin value from 'cents'
            Increment 'coin_count'

    Print 'coin_count' coins
